    The Nintendo Entertainment System, or the NES, was released in July 15, 1983, and was one of Nintendo's first home video game to be released outside of Japan.  This was the second generation console that Nintendo has ever made. The NES was one of the bestselling consoles at that time, selling 61.91 million units worldwide. It also helped revitalize the video game industry due to the incident of the video game crash of 1983 and set standards for consoles from game design to business practices. It also introduced to some big game franchises like Super Mario Brothers, The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid. It was progressively released for many years with different bundles such as the Deluxe set, the Basic Set, The Action Set, and the Power Set. The controllers for the NES were hard-wired to the console and had no connectors for cost reasons. Its designs were reused from the Game & Watch machines, although they originally wanted to use arcade-style joysticks. There were some concerns of the joystick's durability design and that children might step on the controller. They then attached a Game & Watch D-pad for the prototype and found it was easy to use and caused no discomfort. In August 14, 1995, Nintendo discontinued the NES in both the North America and Europe. Replacements for the original NES were available for $25 in exchange for a broken system until around December 1996, under Nintendo's Power Swap program. The Famicom was discontinued in September 2003 and Nintendo offered repair service to it until 2007 when it was discontinued due to the shortage of available parts.

It also remained pretty popular during the 32-bit era as well. It also started some popular franchises like Mega Man X and Star Fox. In Japan, the SNES was actually called the Super Famicom, and in South Korea, it was called the Super Comboy and was distributed by the Hyundai Electronics. The SNES controller added a X and Y button to their design with their original A and B buttons, arranging all four buttons into a diamond shape. They had also added shoulder buttons to their controller. All of the models of the SNES were were predominantly grey and had a boxy design with purple sliding switches and dark grey eject lever.
